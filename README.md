# Scientific_Calculator
This Scientific Calculator is a console-based application developed in C++ during my 2nd semester of college when I was just starting my programming journey. As a beginner, I built this project to practice fundamental C++ concepts, including functions, loops, conditionals, and basic mathematical operations.

Features:
Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
Trigonometric functions along with their inverse operations (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
Exponential and logarithmic calculations 
Angle conversions between degrees and radians
Square root and other essential mathematical functions

This project was an important milestone in my early coding days, helping me understand the logic behind scientific calculations and improving my problem-solving skills. Though simple, it was a great learning experience at the time!
